# Coding Kata Runbook

Everyone develops their own style for solving these.  Most people solve within Leet Code.. I suggest using IntelliJ to
get practice with testing, debugging, intellisense, navigating the tool and setting up basic structural code.

## Setup the project
These steps will be the same for every kata.

- Launch IntelliJ
- Select File -> New -> Project
    - Name it Leet.{number}.{title}   eg Leet.2236.AddTwoIntegers
    - Select Java
    - Check "Add Sample Code"
    - Click the Create Button
    - Click the Run Button and confirm the Console Output says "hello world"

## Setup the kata scaffolding
These steps will be similar for every kata.

- Copy and paste function from Leet Code, returning something (in this case null). eg

```Java
public int sum(int num1, int num2) {
    return 0;
}
```

- Create Test Runner & helper functions

```Java
//Call sum, comparing the result with the expected result... printing PASS or FAIL accordingly
public void testSum(int num1, int num2, int expected) {..}
```
Note above - you could simply use jUnit for all this test & output scaffolding... but it's good practice. When you get bored of it, you can try switching to jUnit for fun.

- Create Tests (start with edge cases & leet code examples)
```Java
main.testSum(0, 0, 0);
main.testSum(1, 1, 2);
main.testSum(-1, 1, 0);
main.testSum(100, 100, 200);
main.testSum(-100, -100, -200);
```

- Run and verify FAILING output (you havenâ€™t implemented sum yet!)


## Finally.. Try to solve the problem

- Try to implement sum using whatever methodology you are comfortable with
  -- Just wing it (many people just do this)
  -- Test Driven Development (interviewers love this approach)
  -- Think about how you solve it as a human, and try to reproduce that in code
- Once your tests are passing, Copy your sum code to Leet Code, and run their Tests
- Submit if their tests pass
- Celebrate if your solution is accepted.. debug if not!

## Extra Credit
- Think about alternate approaches.. try at least one (but don't delete your solution.. create a second method)
- Check out the official solution and/or other submitted solutions.
- Play around with any that seem interesting
