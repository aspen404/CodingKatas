# Coding Kata Runbook

Everyone develops their own style for solving these.  Most people solve within Leet Code.. I suggest using IntelliJ to
get practice with testing, debugging, intellisense, navigating the tool and setting up basic structural code.

## Setup the project
These steps will be the same for every kata.

- Launch IntelliJ
- Select File -> New -> Project
    - Name it Leet.{number}.{title}   eg Leet.1480.RunningSumOf1DArray
    - Check "Add Sample Code"
    - Set language to Javascript
    - Click the Create Button
    - Click the Run Button and confirm the Console Output says "hello world"

## Setup the kata scaffolding
These steps will be similar for every kata.

- Copy and paste function from Leet Code, returning something (in this case the array passed in). eg

```JS
var runningSum = function(nums) {
    return nums;
}
```

- Create Test Runner & helper functions

```JS
//Call runningSum, comparing the result with the expected result.. printing PASS or FAIL accordingly
var testRunningSum = function(nums, expected) {...}
```
Note above - you could simply use jsUnit for all this test & output scaffolding... but it's good practice. When you get bored of it, you can try switching to jUnit for fun.

- Create Tests (start with edge cases & leet code examples)
```JS
//testRunningSum([],[]);
testRunningSum([1], [1]);
testRunningSum([1,2,3,4], [1,3,6,10]);
testRunningSum([1,1,1,1], [1,2,3,4]);
testRunningSum([3,1,2,10,1], [3,4,6,16,17]);
testRunningSum([-1,1,-1,1],[-1,0,-1,0]);
```
Note - Above I commented out my empty array test, because the problem said nums.length > 0 in the Constraint

- Run and verify FAILING output (you havenâ€™t implemented runningSum yet!)


## Finally.. Try to solve the problem

- Try to implement sum using whatever methodology you are comfortable with
  -- Just wing it (many people just do this)
  -- Test Driven Development (interviewers love this approach)
  -- Think about how you solve it as a human, and try to reproduce that in code
- Once your tests are passing, Copy your sum code to Leet Code, and run their Tests
- Submit if their tests pass
- Celebrate if your solution is accepted.. debug if not!

## Extra Credit
- Think about alternate approaches.. try at least one (but don't delete your solution.. create a second method)
- Check out the official solution and/or other submitted solutions.
- Play around with any that seem interesting
