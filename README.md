# CodingKatas
Everywhere else in life - for example Cooking, Sports, Music - we depend on practice to develop excellence. Why don't we
do the same for Software Development?  The answer is that we do - through Coding Katas.

# Site Recommendations

There are a number of good Coding Kata sites... pick any that resonate with you.  If you're not sure or just want to 
follow a recommendation.. go with these.

https://leetcode.com/
This is a polished, professional site with free and paid tiers.  Their Learning blocks are pretty nice.. they teach a bit, 
then enforce through Katas. 

https://projecteuler.net/
These are mathematical puzzles with a deterministic answer that can only be solved through code.. like "calculate the 10,001st Prime Number".  
The site will tell you if you got the answer right or wrong.. but you'd have to google to find sample solutions.

These are a nice change of pace from just Leet Code.. we suggest sprinkling them in now and again, following in the order 
specified on their site.

Note that these can get challenging quickly, and will often run into space or performance considerations.  
For example, an answer might be greater than max integer or even max double! Or, the brute
force approach might crash your ide!

# Examples
In this repository you'll find a few beginner examples in Java and JavaScript. Look at the ReadMe for a suggested way of
approaching these that will build a well-rounded set of skills over time.
